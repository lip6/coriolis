Toolkit Purpose
===============

This toolkit has been created to allow developpers to share through |git| a set
of benchmarks to validate their changes in |Alliance| & |Coriolis| before commiting
and pushing them in their central repositories. A change will be considered as
validated when all the developpers can run successfully all the benchs in their
respective environments.

As a consequence, this repository is likely to be *very* unstable and the commits
not well documenteds as they will be quick corrections made by the developpers.


Release Notes
=============

August 30, 2019
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Katana| is now used as the default router. It can now manage a complete chip design
with I/O pads. As a consequence, the |Makefile| are all modificated, the variable
``USE_KATANA=Yes`` is changed to ``USE_KITE=No`` (see `Benchmark Makefiles`_).

Designs with I/O pads are also modificated to be processed by |Katana| as it uses
a different approach.

|newpage|


Toolkit Contents
================

The toolkit provides:

* **OK Status.** A set of eight benchmark designs that are used as regression tests (see `go.sh`_).
  Benchmarks with multiple target technologies still count as one.

* **KO Status.** Examples that currently fails due to incomplete or poorly implemenented
  features of |Coriolis|.

* **Unchecked.** Non-fonctional examples, or really too long to run for a regression test.

* The |nMigen| design is the basic |ALU| taken from the distribution to perform
  integration test in the design flow. The target technology is the |MOSIS| 180nm
  (``scn6m_deep``).

* The |Arlet6502| is taken from `Arlet's MOS 6502 core`_ and is routed using the
  four metal symbolic technology (so the router has three availables).

* Three cell libraries.

  All thoses libraries are for use with |MOSIS| and |FreePDK45| technologies.
  We provides them as part of the toolkit as we are still in the process of validating
  that technology, and we may have to perform quick fixes on them. The design are
  configured to use them instead of those supplied by the |Alliance| installation.

  #. |nsxlib| : Standard Cell library, compliant with |MOSIS|.
  #. |mpxlib| : Pad library, compliant with |Coriolis|.
  #. |msplib| : Pad library, compliant with |Alliance| / |ring|. Cells in this
     library are *wrappers* around their counterpart in |mpxlib|, they provides
     an outer layout shell that is usable by |ring|.

* The |RDS| files for |MOSIS| (|scn6m_deep_09|) and |FreePDK45| technologies,
  for the same reason as the cell libraries.

* Miscellenous helper scripts.


Toolkit Layout
==============

The files are organized as follow :

===========================================  =======================================================
Directory                                    Contents
===========================================  =======================================================
``./etc/``                                   Configuration files
``./etc/mk/``                                Makefiles rules to build benchmarks. This directory
                                             must be symbolic linked into each benchmark directory
``./etc/mk/users.d/``                        Directory holding the configuration for each user
``./bin/``                                   Additionnal scripts
``./cells/<LIBDIR>``                         Standard cells libraries.

===========================================  =======================================================

|newpage|


Benchmark Makefiles
===================

A benchmark |Makefile| is build by setting up variables ``USE_<FEATURE>=Yes/No``
then including the set of rules ``./mk/design-flow.mk``. The directory
``alliance-check-toolkit/etc/mk/`` must be symlinked in the directory where the
|Makefile| resides.

The |Makefile| provides some or all of the following targets. If the place
and route stage of a benchmark has multiple target technology, one directory
is created for each.

+--------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Where variables have the following meaning:

=========================  ===========================================================
Variable                   Usage
=========================  ===========================================================
``LOGICAL_SYNTHESIS``      Tells what synthesis tool to use between ``Alliance`` or
                           ``Yosys``. Netlists must be pre-generated if this variable
			   is empty or not present
``PHYSICAL_SYNTHESIS``     Tells what place & route tools to use between ``Alliance``
                           (i.e. |ocp|, |nero| & |ring|) and ``Coriolis``
``DESIGN_KIT``             The target technology and the standard cell libraries to
                           use, for the supported values see below.
``NETLISTS``               The list of *netlists* that are requireds to perform the
                           place and route stage. See the complete explanation below
``VST_FLAGS``              Flags to be passed to the tools driving |vst| files.
                           Due to some non-standard syntax in the |Alliance| format,
			   if you have a hierarchical design, please set it to
			   ``--vst-use-concat``
``USE_CLOCKTREE``          Adds a clock-tree to the design (|Coriolis|)
``USE_DEBUG``              Use the debugger enabled version of |cgt|
``USE_KITE``               Use the old |Kite| (digital only) router
=========================  ===========================================================

Detailed semantic of the ``NETLISTS`` variable:

* Netlists name must be given without file extensions. Those are guessed according
  to the selected synthesis tool.

* According to the value of ``LOGICAL_SYNTHESIS`` they are user supplied or generated.
  In the later case, be aware that calling the ``clean`` target will remove
  the generated files.

* In case the logical synthesis stage is needed, the file holding the behavioral
  description is the *first* of the item list. In certain contexts, it will also be
  considered as the chip's core.

* If the behavioral description is hierarchical, each sub model must be added to
  the ``NETLISTS`` variable (*after* the top level one). In case of |Yosys|
  synthesis, |blif2vst| will generate a |vst| file for each model of the
  hierarchy. We add them to the list so a ``make clean`` will remove not only
  the top level |vst| (and associated |ap| after placement), but the whole
  hierarchy.

A slightly more complex example is below. The behavioral description that will
be synthetised must be in ``alu_hier`` (in fact ``alu_hier.il`` or ``alu_hier.v``
as we are using |Yosys|). Two sub-model are generated by the synthesis, ``add``
and ``sub``, so we add them in tail of the ``NETLISTS`` variable.

Setting Up the User's Environement
==================================

Before running the benchmarks, you must create a configuration file to tell
where all the softwares are installeds. The file is to be created in the directory: ::

    alliance-check-toolkit/etc/mk/users.d/

The file itself must be named from your username, if mine is ``jpc``: ::

    alliance-check-toolkit/etc/mk/users.d/user-jpc.mk

Example of file contents:

.. code-block:: Makefile

    # Where Jean-Paul Chaput gets his tools installeds.
  
    export NDA_TOP       = ${HOME}/crypted/soc/techno
    export AMS_C35B4     = ${NDA_TOP}/AMS/035hv-4.10
    export FreePDK_45    = ${HOME}/coriolis-2.x/work/DKs/FreePDK45
    export CORIOLIS_TOP  = $(HOME)/coriolis-2.x/$(BUILD_VARIANT)$(LIB_SUFFIX_)/$(BUILD_TYPE_DIR)/install
    export ALLIANCE_TOP  = $(HOME)/alliance/$(BUILD_VARIANT)$(LIB_SUFFIX_)/install
    export CHECK_TOOLKIT = $(HOME)/coriolis-2.x/src/alliance-check-toolkit
    export AVERTEC_TOP   = /dsk/l1/tasyag/Linux.el7_64/install
    export YOSYS_TOP     = /usr

All the variable names and values are more or less self explanatory...


|Coriolis| Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike |Alliance| which is entirely configured through environement variables
or system-wide configuration file, |Coriolis| uses configuration files in
the current directory. They are present for each bench:

* ``<cwd>/coriolis2/__init__.py`` : Just to tell |Python| that this directory
  contains a module and be able to *import* it.
* ``<cwd>/coriolis2/settings.py`` : Override system configuration, and setup
  technology.


|Coriolis| and Clock Tree Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When |Coriolis| is used, it create a clock tree which modificate the original
netlist. The new netlist, with a clock tree, has a postfix of ``_clocked``.

.. note:: **Trans-hierarchical Clock-Tree.** As |Coriolis| do not flatten the
   designs it creates, not only the top-level netlist is modificated. All the
   sub-blocks connected to the master clock are also duplicateds, whith the
   relevant part of the clock-tree included.


|RHEL6| and Clones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under |RHEL6| the developpement version of |Coriolis| needs the |devtoolset-2|.
``os.mk`` tries, based on ``uname`` to switch it on or off.

|newpage|


Yosys Wrapper Script |yosys.py|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As far as I understand, |yosys| do not allow it's scripts to be parametriseds.
The |yosys.py| script is a simple wrapper around |yosys| that generate a
custom tailored |tcl| script then call |yosys| itself. It can manage two
input file formats, |Verilog| and |RTLIL| and produce a |blif| netlist.

.. code-block:: bash

   ego@home:VexRiscv/cmos350$ ../../../bin/yosys.py \
                                          --input-lang=Verilog  \
                                          --design=VexRiscv     \
                                          --top=VexRiscv        \
					  --liberty=../../../cells/nsxlib/nsxlib.lib
   

Here is an example of generated |tcl| script: ``VexRiscv.ys``:

.. code-block:: tcl

   set verilog_file VexRiscv.v
   set verilog_top  VexRiscv
   set liberty_file .../alliance-check-toolkit/cells/nsxlib/nsxlib.lib
   yosys read_verilog          $verilog_file
   yosys hierarchy -check -top $verilog_top
   yosys synth            -top $verilog_top
   yosys dfflibmap -liberty    $liberty_file
   yosys abc       -liberty    $liberty_file
   yosys clean
   yosys write_blif VexRiscv.blif


Benchmarks Special Notes
========================

|alliance-run|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This benchmark comes mostly with it's own rules and do not uses the ones supplieds
by |rules_mk|. It uses only the top-level configuration variables.

It a sligtly modified copy of the |alliance-run| found in the |Alliance| package
(modification are all in the |Makefile|). It build an |AM2901|, but it is
splitted in a control and an operative part (data-path). This is to also check
the data-path features of |Alliance|.

And lastly, it provides a check for the |Coriolis| encapsulation of |Alliance|
through |Python| wrappers. The support is still incomplete and should be used
only by very experienced users. See the ``demo*`` rules.


|AM2901| standard cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This benchmark can be run in loop to check slight variations. The clock tree generator
modify the netlist trans-hierarchically then saves the new netlist. But, when there's
a block *without* a clock (say an |ALU| for instance) it is not modificated yet saved.
So the ``vst`` file got rewritten. And while the netlist is rewritten
in a deterministic way (from how it was parsed), it is *not* done the same way due
to instance and terminal re-ordering. So, from run to run, we get identical netlists
but different files inducing slight variations in how the design is placed and routed.
We use this *defect* to generate deterministic series of random variation that helps
check the router. All runs are saved in a ``./runs`` sub-directory.

The script to perform a serie of run is ``./doRun.sh``.

To reset the serie to a specific run (for debug), you may use ``./setRun.sh``.


|newpage|


Libraries Makefiles
===================

.. note::
   For those part to work, you need to get |hitas| & |yagle|:

       `HiTas -- Static Timing Analyser <https://soc-extras.lip6.fr/en/tasyag-abstract-en/>`_


The ``bench/etc/mk/check-library.mk`` provides rules to perform the check of a library
as a whole or cell by cell. To avoid too much clutter in the library directory,
all the intermediate files generated by the verification tools are kept in a
``./check/`` subdirectory. Once a cell has been validated, a ``./check/<cell>.ok``
is generated too prevent it to be checked again in subsequent run. If you
want to force the recheck of the cell, do not forget to remove this file.


Checking Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* DRC with |druc|.
* Formal proof between the layout and the behavioral description. This is a
  somewhat long chain of tools:

  #. |cougar|, extract the spice netlist (``.spi``).
  #. |yagle|, rebuild a behavioral description (``.vhd``) from the spice
     netlist.
  #. |vasy|, convert the ``.vhd`` into a ``.vbe`` (Alliance |VHDL| subset
     for behavioral descriptions).
  #. |proof|, perform the formal proof between the refence ``.vbe`` and the
     extracted one.


=========================  ===================================================
Rule or File               Action
=========================  ===================================================
``check-lib``              Validate every cell of the library
``clean-lib-tmp``          Remove all intermediate files in the ``./check``
                           subdirectory **except** for the ``*.ok`` ones.
                           That is, cells validated will not be rechecked.
``clean-lib``              Remove all files in ``./check``, including ``*.ok``
``./check/<cell>.ok``      Use this rule to perform the individual check of 
                           ``<cell>``. If the cell is validated, a file of
                           the same name will be created, preventing the cell
                           to be checked again.
=========================  ===================================================


Synopsys Liberty .lib Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generation of the liberty file is only half-automated. |hitas| / |yagle|
build the base file, then we manually perform the two modifications (see below).

The rule to call to generate the liberty file is: ``<libname>-dot-lib`` where
``<libname>`` is the name of the library. To avoid erasing the previous one (and
presumably hand patched), this rule create a ``<libname>.lib.new``.

#. Run the ``./bin/cellsArea.py`` script which will setup the areas of the cells
   (in square um). Work on ``<libname>.lib.new``.

#. For the synchronous flip-flop, add the functional description to their
   timing descriptions: ::

    cell (sff1_x4) {
      pin (ck) {
        direction : input ;
        clock : true ;
        /* Timing informations ... */
      }
      pin (q) {
        direction : output ;
        function : "IQ" ;
        /* Timing informations ... */
      }
      ff(IQ,IQN) {
        next_state : "i" ;
        clocked_on : "ck" ;
      }
    }

    cell (sff2_x4) {
      pin (ck) {
        direction : input ;
        clock : true ;
        /* Timing informations ... */
      }
      pin (q) {
        direction : output ;
        function : "IQ" ;
        /* Timing informations ... */
      }
      ff(IQ,IQN) {
        next_state : "(cmd * i1) + (cmd' * i0)" ;
        clocked_on : "ck" ;
      }
    }


.. note::
   The tristate cells **ts_** and **nts_** are not included in the ``.lib``.


Helpers Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|TCL| scripts for |avt_shell| related to cell validation and characterization,
in ``./benchs/bin``, are:

* ``extractCell.tcl``, read a spice file and generate a |VHDL| behavioral
  description (using |yagle|). This file needs to be processed further by
  |vasy| to become an Alliance behavioral file (|vbe|). It takes two
  arguments: the technology file and the cell spice file.
  Cell which name starts by ``sff`` will be treated as D flip-flop.

* ``buildLib.tcl``, process all cells in a directory to buil a liberty
  file. Takes two arguments, the technology file and the name of the
  liberty file to generate. The collection of characterized cells will
  be determined by the ``.spi`` files found in the current directory.


Macro-Blocks Makefiles
======================

The ``bench/etc/mk/check-generator.mk`` provides rules to perform the check of a
macro block generator. As one library cell may be used to build multiple macro-blocks,
one |Makefile| per macro must be provided. The *dot* extension of a |Makefile| is
expected to be the name of the macro-block. Here is a small example for the register
file generator, ``Makefile.block_rf2``:

.. code-block:: Makefile

                      TK_RTOP = ../..
     export      MBK_CATA_LIB = $(TOOLKIT_CELLS_TOP)/nrf2lib
    
     include $(TK_RTOP)/etc/mk/alliance.mk
     include $(TK_RTOP)/etc/mk/mosis.mk
     include $(TK_RTOP)/etc/mk/check-generator.mk
    
    check-gen: ./check/block_rf2_p_b_4_p_w_6.ok   \
               ./check/block_rf2_p_b_2_p_w_32.ok  \
               ./check/block_rf2_p_b_64_p_w_6.ok  \
               ./check/block_rf2_p_b_16_p_w_32.ok \
               ./check/block_rf2_p_b_32_p_w_32.ok

.. note::
   In the ``check-gen`` rule, the name of the block **must** match the *dot*
   extension of the |Makefile|, here: ``block_rf2``.

Macro-block generators are parametrized. We uses a special naming convention
to pass parameters names and values trough the rule name. To declare a parameter,
add ``_p_``, then the name of the parameter and it's value separated by a ``_``.

==========================  ===============================
String in Rule Name         Call to the generator
==========================  ===============================
``_p_b_16_p_w_32``          ``-b 16 -w 32``
==========================  ===============================

When multiple flavor of a generator could be built upon the same cell library,
one |Makefile| per flavor is provided. To run them all at once, a ``makeAll.sh``
script is also available.

The ``check-gen`` rule only perform a |DRC| and a |LVS| to check that their
router as correctly connected the cells of a macro-block. It doesn't perform
any functional verification.
 
To perform a functional abstraction with |Yagle| you may use the following
command: ::

    ego@home:nrf2lib> make -f Makefile.block_rf2 block_rf2_b_4_p_w_6_kite.vhd

Even if the resulting |VHDL| cannot be used it is always good to look in
the report file ``block_rf2_b_4_p_w_6_kite.rep`` for any error or warning,
particularly any disconnected transistor.


Calling the Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script ``./check/generator.py`` must be written in order to call the generator
in standalone mode. This script is quite straigthforward, what changes between
generators is the command line options and the ``stratus.buildModel()`` call.

After the generator call, we get a netlist and placement, but it is not finished
until it is routed with the |Coriolis| router.

.. note::
   Currently all macro-block generators are part of the |Stratus| netlist capture
   language tool from |Coriolis|.


Scaling the Cell Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This operation has to be done once, when the cell library is initially ported.
The result is put in the |git| repository, so there's no need to run it again
on a provided library.

The script is ``./check/scaleCell.py``. It is very sensitive on the way
the library pathes are set in ``.coriolis2/settings.py``. It must have the
target cell library setup as the ``WORKING_LIBRARY`` and the source cell
library in the ``SYSTEM_LIBRARY``. The technology must be set to the target
one. And, of course, the script must be run the directory where ``.coriolis2/``
is located.

The heart of the script is the ``scaleCell()`` function, which work on the
original cell in variable ``sourceCell`` (argument) and ``scaledCell``, the
converted one. Although the script is configured to use the *scaled*
technology, this do not affect the values of the coordinates of the cells
we read, whatever their origin. This means that when we read the ``sourceCell``,
the coordinates of it's components keeps the value they have under ``SxLib``.
It is *when* we duplicate them into the ``scaledCell`` that we perform the
scaling (i.e. multiply by two) and do whatever adjustments we need.
So when we have an adjustment to do on a specific segment, say slihgtly shift
a ``NDIF``, the coordinates must be expressed as in ``SxLib`` (once more: *before*
scaling).
 
.. note::
   There is a safety in ``./check/scaleCell.py``, it will not run until the
   target library has not been emptied of it's cells.

The script contains a ``getDeltas()`` function which provide a table on how
to resize some layers (width and extension).

As the scaling operations is very specific to each macro-block, this script
is *not* shared, but customized for each one.
 

Tools & Scripts
===============


.. _go.sh:

One script to run them all: |go|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To call all the bench's ``Makefile`` sequentially and execute one or more rules on
each, the small script utility |go| is available. Here are some examples: ::

    ego@home:bench$ ./bin/go.sh clean
    ego@home:bench$ ./bin/go.sh lvx


Command Line |cgt|: |doChip|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a alternative to |cgt|, the small helper script |doChip| allows to
perform all the P&R tasks, on an stand-alone block or a whole chip.


Blif Netlist Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |blif2vst| script convert a ``.blif`` netlist into an |Alliance| one
(|vst|). This is a very straightforward encapsulation of |Coriolis|.
It could have been included in |doChip|, but then the ``make`` rules
would have been much more complicateds.


Pad Layout Converter |px2mpx|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |px2mpx| script convert pad layout from the |pxlib| (|Alliance| dummy
technology) into |mpxlib| (|MOSIS| compliant symbolic technology).

Basically it multiplies all the coordinate by two as the source technology
is 1µ type and the target one a 2µ. In addition it performs some adjustement
on the wire extension and minimal width and the blockage sizes.

As it is a one time script, it is heavily hardwired, so before using it
do not forget to edit it to suit your needs.

The whole conversion process is quite tricky as we are cheating with the
normal use of the software. The steps are as follow:

1. Using the |Alliance| dummy technology and in an empty directory, run
   the script. The layouts of the converted pads (``*_mpx.ap``) will be
   created.

2. In a second directory, this time configured for the |MOSIS| technology
   (see ``.coriolis2_techno.conf``) copy the converted layouts. In addition
   to the layouts, this directory **must also contain** the behavioral
   description of the pads (``.vbe``). Otherwise, you will not be able to
   see the proper layout.

3. When you are satisfied with the new layout of the pads, you can copy
   them back in the official pad cell library.

.. note:: **How Coriolis Load Cells.**
   Unlike in |Alliance|, |Coriolis| maintain a much tighter relationship
   between physical and logical (structural or behavioral) views. The
   loading process of a cell try *first* to load the logical view, and
   if found, keep tab of the directory it was in. *Second* it tries to
   load the physical view from the same directory the logical view was
   in. If no logical view is found, only the physical is loaded.

   Conversely, when saving a cell, the directory it was loaded from
   is kept, so that the cell will be overwritten, and not duplicated
   in the working directory as it was in |Alliance|.

   This explains why the behavioral view of the pad is needed in
   the directory the layouts are put into. Otherwise you would only see
   the pads of the system library (if any).


|Cadence| Support
=================

To perform comparisons with |Cadence| |EDI| tools (i.e. |encounter|
|NanoRoute|), some benchmarks have a sub-directory ``encounter``
holding all the necessary files. Here is an example for the design
named ``<fpga>``.

===========================  =================================================
                     ``encounter`` directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Name                    Contents
===========================  =================================================
``fpga_export.lef``          Technology & standard cells for the design
``fpga_export.def``          The design itself, flattened to the standard
                             cells.
``fpga_nano.def``            The placed and routed result.
``fpga.tcl``                 The |TCL| script to be run by |encounter|
===========================  =================================================

The LEF/DEF file exported or imported by Coriolis are *not* true physical
files. They are pseudo-real, in the sense that all the dimensions are
directly taken from the symbolic with the simple rule ``1 lambda = 1 micron``.

.. note:: **LEF/DEF files:** Coriolis is able to import/export in those
   formats only if it has been compiled against the |Si2| relevant libraries
   that are subjects to specific license agreements. So in case we don't
   have access to thoses we supplies the generated LEF/DEF files.

The ``encounter`` directory contains the LEF/DEF files and the |TCL|
script to be run by |encounter|: ::

    ego@home:encounter> . ../../etc/EDI1324.sh
    ego@home:encounter> encounter -init ./fpga.tcl
